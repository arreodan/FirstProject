                  <p class=>Sentient and ambulatory plant-being Groot left his Flora colossus people behind on their native Planet X to travel out into the galaxy. Both before and after meeting the genetically enhanced creature known as Rocket, Groot racked up an impressive list of criminal charges from the Nova Corps police force while working for crime lords in various capacities.
                  <br><br>Together, Groot and Rocket finally concentrated on being bounty hunters, a job that took them to many exotic worlds. Upon tracking Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord, to Xandar for the bounty on his head, Groot and Rocket ran afoul of the assassin Gamora and wound up arrested by the Nova Corps. They were incarcerated in the Kyln prison complex alongside Quill and Gamora, where they also met the warrior Drax.
                  <br><br>They teamed up with their fellow inmates to fence the Orb, a mysterious artifact that Quill claimed could be sold for immense wealth if Groot and the others would help him escape lock-up.
                  <br><br>Composed of matter resembling that of wood and possessing a fully functioning brain system, Groot can “grow” most anything he needs at any given time from his body, such as weapons for fighting, protective barriers for himself or others, and even flowers to give to special someones. Not usually overly talkative, he communicates with what appears to be a single phrase, “I am Groot,” but which can be translated to mean a multitude of things, as if stated in a full language format.
                  <br><br>When provoked or threatened, Groot transforms from peaceful tree-person into a mighty warrior with a hint of savagery—characteristics he exhibits regardless of what age he appears to be. As a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Groot joins the fight against cosmic threats like Ronan and Ego, and eventually Thanos and his followers.
